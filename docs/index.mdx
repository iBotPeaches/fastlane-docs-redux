_fastlane_ is the easiest way to automate beta deployments and releases for your iOS and Android apps. 🚀 It handles all tedious tasks, like generating screenshots, dealing with code signing, and releasing your application.

You can start by creating a `Fastfile` file in your repository, here’s one that defines your beta or App Store release process:

```ruby
lane :beta do
  increment_build_number
  build_app
  upload_to_testflight
end

lane :release do
  capture_screenshots
  build_app
  upload_to_app_store       # Upload the screenshots and the binary to iTunes
  slack                     # Let your team-mates know the new version is live
end
```

You just defined 2 different lanes, one for beta deployment, one for App Store. To release your app in the App Store, all you have to do is

```no-highlight
fastlane release
```

Special thanks to all [contributors](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/graphs/contributors) for extending and improving _fastlane_.

## Metrics
 
_fastlane_ tracks a few key metrics to understand how developers are using the tool and to help us know what areas need improvement. No personal/sensitive information is ever collected. Metrics that are collected include: 
 
* The number of _fastlane_ runs
* A salted hash of the app identifier or package name, which helps us anonymously identify unique usage of _fastlane_
 
You can easily opt-out of metrics collection by adding `opt_out_usage` at the top of your `Fastfile` or by setting the environment variable `FASTLANE_OPT_OUT_USAGE`. [Check out the metrics code on GitHub](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/fastlane_core/lib/fastlane_core/analytics)
